# Caesar-Cypher-using-Excel
We all have private information we want to keep
private, but sometimes need to share it with select individuals
(e.g., our doctor, lawyer, spouse, etc.). With over 4.2B others
on the Internet, who can we make sure this information is
available (Availability), only to the right audience
(Confidentiality), and has not been altered (Integrity).
The answer is encryption.
Julius Caesar had a similar need to keep his military
instructions secret from the enemy, but known to his
generals. In this excercise we will recreate the encryption method
devised by Caesar!
– Applied knowledge of strings and substring.
– determined the length of a text string then find and index
substrings and individual characters within a text string.
– composed strings by adding substrings.
– combined string functions to perform complex operations.
– described the mechanics of Caesar Cypher.
– demonstrated the difference between symmetric key
encryption and asymmetric key encryption.
